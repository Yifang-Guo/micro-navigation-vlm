Reach gently ahead: the cane will now strike a broad, flat wooden platform only shin-high; this is the seat base inside the large circular magenta frame. Slide one small step forward and bend your knees—the slatted chair surface sits just below knee level, backed by the curved ring rising over your head."

You'll first feel the smooth coated steel side of the black general-waste unit; its front panel is flat and cool, with a rectangular drop slot about waist height and raised lettering near the top. Immediately flush against its right side is the blue recycling unit; its metal feels the same but the lid slopes gently inward and has a round opening rim you can locate by sliding your hand upward about 10 cm from the slot on the black bin."

    "ans_gt": "Starting from your position on the smooth footpath, walk straight ahead about four short steps (roughly 2 metres) until your cane taps the first curved metal rack of the bicycle station, which rises to knee height; keep the racks centred slightly to your right side as you advance, then take one additional half-step so your shins align with the front rail—this places you safely within the parking bay, with the standing loops stretching left-to-right before you and the parked bicycle detectable a forearm's length to your right."

    "ans_gt": "From where you're paused on the smooth brick paving, angle your body a quarter-turn to the right so you're facing the line of low wooden benches, then extend your cane forward—after a single short step (about half a metre) the tip will meet the nearest bench's front metal leg at ankle level; slide the cane rightward along that leg until it tucks under the seat, take one more half-step so your shins lightly touch the bench's edge, and you'll be centred on the seat with the broad walkway stretching off to your left and a raised flowerbed and boulder directly behind the bench for easy orientation."

Could you please guide me to it using tactile cues based on the scene shown in the image?",
    "ans_gt": "Walk straight ahead between the two stainless-steel bollards (each has a yellow band you can feel near hand height); keep your cane lightly brushing the right-hand bollard's base, and you'll follow a clear brick path for about three metres until the cane taps the metal rail that borders the row of shopping trolleys on your left—continue forward another two steps keeping that rail on your left shoulder, then angle gently right and sweep the cane; within a single pace the tip will strike the textured rubber door mat and the recessed aluminium threshold of the sliding entrance doors, which will open automatically as you step onto the mat with the glass wall on your left and the Aldi sign directly in front of you."

    "ans_gt": "Move straight ahead along the raised white zebra stripes beneath your feet; after about five strides your cane will tap the shallow kerb at the far side—step up and continue forward, letting the cane glide between the two waist-high stainless-steel bollards (one at either shoulder); two more steps bring the cane onto a ribbed rubber mat in front of the automatic sliding doors, which will open as soon as the cane tip or your leading foot touches the metal threshold, guiding you directly into the Lidl entrance."

    "ans_gt": "Keep the solid stone wall brushing your right arm and walk straight ahead about five paces until your cane bumps the first bumpy-dot tactile tile; continue another two short steps and you'll feel a second patch of raised dots underfoot—stop there, pivot a quarter-turn left toward the curb, and reach forward: your cane will strike the metal guard-rail, then the smooth pole directly beyond it is the traffic-light post with its button positioned at hip height."

    "ans_gt": "Stay beside the stone wall on your left and walk straight uphill for roughly fifteen medium paces—your cane will stay on smooth pavement until, about two steps before the shelter, it taps the shallow recessed doorway, then the metal frame of the glass bus-stop enclosure; turn left into that recess, step forward one stride, and you'll be under the shelter roof with the timetable panel immediately on your left and the bench ahead."

    "ans_gt": "Turn your cane to the right until it taps a straight, raised curb edge and follow that curb with small steps—your cane will stay on smooth asphalt until you feel a row of rectangular tactile pips underfoot; that pipped strip marks the edge of the road. From there, turn your body toward the pips and take one deliberate step forward off the curb (you'll feel a slight drop beneath your feet). Now continue forward until your cane again glides over smooth paving stones—that change in texture means you've climbed up onto the sidewalk."

    "ans_gt": "Turn your cane forward in short, sweeping arcs along the ground to detect the change from the rougher brick-pattern pavers underfoot to the smoother concrete running right up to the doorway. Once you feel the flat, even surface extend straight ahead, continue tapping until your cane tip lightly brushes against the vertical metal frame of the door on your right. From there, pivot toward that frame and step forward until you're level with the door sensors—your cane will no longer slide over pavers but over smooth concrete. Now simply move straight ahead a few confident steps and you've reached the entrance."

    "ans_gt": "Face your cane perpendicular to the ground and sweep gently forward until the tip glides over loose wood chips underfoot, then continue straight ahead—your cane will soon tap on the smooth, squared metal leg of the bench. At that point, pivot slightly to your right and step forward so your cane follows the straight edge of the seat's metal leg to the corner of the bench. Once you feel the flat, horizontal underside of the wooden plank above your cane tip, you've found the seat; turn toward it and reach out to sit down."

    "ans_gt": "Take a couple of measured steps straight ahead, keeping your cane tip sweeping the smooth asphalt; you'll first encounter the slender post of the information board (you'll feel its round, metal leg with a yellow loop at its base). When you hit that, pivot your body slightly left and continue forward—your cane will now tap on a series of low, U-shaped metal bars set into the ground. Those repeated hard 'clicks' under your cane are the bicycle racks you're looking for."

At that point you'll feel the vertical metal door frame right beside the smooth rubber edge of the mat—just follow the frame until you find the door activation panel or push into the sliding glass entrance."

Once you feel that change in surface, take three measured steps forward and run your cane along the long handrail on your right—that rail leads directly up the staircase. Place your hand on it and you'll be at the bottom step's nosing, ready to ascend."
