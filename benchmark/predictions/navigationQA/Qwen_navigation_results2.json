    "scene": "- **Left Sector**\n  - Name: Eggplants\n  - Distance Category: Close\n  - Height Band: Floor\n\n- **Centre Sector**\n  - Name: Cauliflower, Corn, Green Peppers\n  - Distance Category: Close\n  - Height Band: Floor\n\n- **Right Sector**\n  - Name: Various Fruits and Vegetables\n  - Distance Category: Mid\n  - Height Band: Floor",
    "answer": "Starting from your current position in the centre of the scene, move forward towards the mid-sector. As you walk, you'll notice the cauliflower and green peppers at your feet, both classified as close and on the floor. After passing these, look for the corn; it's in the same distance category and height band. To locate the corncob, it should be either to your right or left, providing a tactile identification through its shape or texture. If you need further assistance, feel free to specify which direction you think it might be."

    "question": "I am visually impaired, and the scene depicted in the image represents my current view. I wish to obtain kiwifruit. Could you please guide me to it using tactile cues based on the scene shown in the image?",
    "scene": "- **Left Sector**\n  - Stacks of boxes with produce (close, floor)\n  - Shopping cart (mid, floor)\n  - Person pushing cart (mid, waist)\n  - Signage on ceiling (far, above head)\n\n- **Centre Sector**\n  - Produce display (close, floor)\n  - Signage on ceiling (mid, above head)\n  - People shopping (mid, waist)\n  - Signage on wall (far, above head)\n\n- **Right Sector**\n  - Produce display (close, floor)\n  - Shopping cart (mid, floor)\n  - Signage on wall (mid, above head)\n  - People shopping (mid, waist)\n  - Signage on ceiling (far, above head)",
    "answer": "Starting from your current position, which is in the centre sector, move forward towards the closest produce display, keeping in mind that the kiwifruits will be on the floor. As you approach, you'll notice the smoothness of the fruit, slightly round and firm to the touch. If you encounter a stack of boxes, gently lift one to feel the weight and texture of the kiwis. If you need assistance, the shopping cart is in the mid-range, so you can use it as a reference for height. Remember to avoid the people shopping around you, but don't hesitate to ask for help if needed. Once you locate the kiwifruits, you can identify them by their fuzzy skin and slightly sweet aroma."
