Here is where I stand, and the scene depicted in the image is the view in front of me.The target object I want to approach is: fire assembly point. Could you please guide me to it using tactile cues based on the scene shown in the image?",
    "instruction": "To guide you to the fire assembly point using tactile cues, here's a step-by-step approach based on the scene:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Ensure you are facing the open grassy area.\n\n2. **Move Forward**: Carefully walk straight across the grass. The ground may feel slightly uneven due to small plants and the natural texture of the grass.\n\n3. **Listen for the Road**: As you move forward, listen for the change in texture or a slight incline as you approach the road. You'll also hear the change from the soft grass to the harder surface of the road.\n\n4. **Locate the Sign**: Once you reach the edge of the road, you'll need to cross to the other side where the sign is. Proceed with caution and listen for traffic.\n\n5. **Signage Area**: When you are across, reach out carefully to your front to feel for the signpost. It is located along the path of the road and should be detectable as you reach out.\n\n6. **Final Destination**: The fire assembly point signage should be around that area.\n\nEnsure you move slowly and use a cane or other mobility aid if available for better safety and orientation."
