    "answer": "Starting from your current position, which is in the centre sector, move forward towards the target object, following the rough distance category of close (\u22483 steps). As you walk, keep in mind that the height band is on the floor. You'll come across the elevator first; feel for the raised edges to identify it. After the elevator, notice the fire extinguisher; its cool metal surface will give a different texture compared to the surrounding. Once you pass the yellow caution sign, you should see the glass doors with exit signs. Feel the smooth surface of the doors for guidance. If needed, the green board nearby can serve as a reference point for direction. Remember, the recycling bins are located to your right, but they won't obstruct your path to the exit. As you approach the exit door, which is in the right sector, you'll be able to recognize it by its size and shape, or perhaps by a distinctive handle or push plate. Keep going until you reach the target; make sure to check all these details for a safe and tactile identification."

    "answer": "Starting from your current position, which is in the centre sector, move forward towards the target object, the fire extinguisher. As you traverse, keep in mind that the distance is marked as mid, meaning it's not too far but not close either. On your way, you'll notice the left sector, where the Noticeboard is located, at a distance suitable for close inspection. The blue double doors in the centre sector are right ahead, their height level with your knees, marking them as mid-distance. Remembering the target object's location at the height band of the knee, focus on the Right Sector; the fire extinguisher will be easily identifiable by its size and texture when you reach it. Stay cautious and follow the pathway described."
