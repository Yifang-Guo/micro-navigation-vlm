To approach the target object, which is the entrance, start by moving towards it from your current position. As you walk, focus on the left sector, where you'll find bollards close by. These should feel firm and provide tactile reference points for your navigation. Once you reach the door with the accessibility symbol, a noticeable change in height will mark its knee-level, making it easy to identify. Keep moving straight until you come to the signboard, also at knee-height, which will be another touch point. Finally, as you continue towards the right, you'll encounter the green gate and a brick wall, both at knee-height. The entrance should be distinguishable by its distinct shape or texture, so pay attention to those details as you approach. Remember to rely on your sense of touch to locate the entrance and confirm its identity."

To your left, you see trees that are far away, categorized as 'Far'. The target object you need to approach is the 'entrance', which is located in the right sector. For a visually impaired individual, I will guide you using tactile cues. First, take a step forward towards the building, ensuring your feet make contact with the ground at the mid-distance mark. As you walk, focus on the texture of the floor, which should be smooth or have a distinct pattern. When you reach the point where the building's wall meets the glass door, you'll feel the change in material. The entrance will be at a knee-height level, so look for a raised lip or handle that feels cool to the touch, indicating the entrance. Remember to use your hands to locate and verify the target."

For the target object, the bus station, it's located in the far right sector, indicated by its distant presence and the mention of trees and buildings in the background. To identify it, you can focus on the texture of the pavement or the change in elevation, as bus stations often have distinct architectural features like a raised platform or a bus stop sign. Remember to maintain a clear line of sight and rely on your surroundings for guidance."
