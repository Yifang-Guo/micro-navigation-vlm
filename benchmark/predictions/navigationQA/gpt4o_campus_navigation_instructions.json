Here\u2019s how you can approach the water bottle:\n\n1. **Orient Yourself**: Face the direction you are currently standing.\n\n2. **Move Forward**: Walk straight ahead, maintaining a steady pace.\n\n3. **Use the Wall for Guidance**: Keep your right hand lightly trailing along the wall to your right side as you move forward.\n\n4. **Locate the First Gap (Door)**: As you walk, you will first encounter a door-like gap in the wall on your right after a few steps. Continue past this door while staying close to the wall.\n\n5. **Reach the Next Section**: Shortly after the door, you'll reach another section of the wall. The water bottle is placed on a ledge or surface at waist height in this section.\n\n6. **Tactile Check**: You can stop and feel the surface when you believe you are in the right section to locate the bottle.\n\nThe water bottle should be around this area on the shelf. Let me know if you need more guidance!"
